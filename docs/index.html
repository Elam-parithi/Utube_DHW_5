        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This product was writen by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elamparithi-t">Elamparithi</a>. This project was built by modules used above. Streamlit was limited
            abilities. And it uses MySQL and MongoDB for data storage. This intention of this project was intended to
            provide rich and premium look on UI and working application to
            Also, this application will be rich in UI with premium colors despite using streamlit. 
            Used Matplotlib with seabors for premium charts.  
        </p>
        <p>
            for detials on how to clone and deploy for your self. look at the 
            <a href="https://github.com/Elam-parithi/Utube_DHW_5/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> file.
        </p>
        <h3># Config page:</h3>
        <img src="images\config_page.PNG" alt="analysis result">
        <p>
            In config page we provide the API key from google website, and SQL and MongoDB URL and URI.
            When you click on the connect button if passed the status bar will turn the color to green.
            if it was in red the connection/key was not working. if in orange the no entry yet.
            only MongoDB is optional. API key and MySQL URL was important.
        </p><p>
            For this configuration read the text above the entry button. Or you can go with detialed configuration
            on <a href="https://github.com/Elam-parithi/Utube_DHW_5/blob/main/config_page.md">configuration.md</a> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            you can also configure the secrets with streamlit secrets file. get how to configure at 
            <a href="https://github.com/Elam-parithi/Utube_DHW_5/blob/main/secret_configuration.md">secret_configuration.md</a>
            Also, keep your secret seperate and make sure to add it to <i>.gitignore</i> file.
        </p>
        <h3># Home Page</h3>
        <img src="images\homepage.PNG" alt="Home page">
        <p>
            In his page we will extract the data from the Google's YouTube API. You enter multiple Channel names,
            Channel ID in the entry box. It will automatically get the respective channel id with given channel name.
            the max limit was set to 10. change that in configuration mention above.
            <pre>
                My advise is to select the channels with lower playlist,videos, comments. 
                it can processed fast on testing time. And don't exced the free token limit.
            </pre> 
            In Background of this page the data was stored in <b>JSON file format</b> with date and time in it.
            So, you can get multiple channels at any given time and process for visualization at any time.
            More channels means more compute power and More tokens. Google's Free youtube API token was limited to 10,000 only.
            For more detials visit <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started">YouTube documentation</a>.

        <img src="images\storagepage.PNG" alt="Storage Page">
        <p>
            This page where the converted data was uploaded to MySQL and MongoDB. If you want to proccess with MongoDB click the checkbox.
            Else leve it empty. And there will be download button shown. where you can download the JSON file for yourself.
            This helps with Tableau. you can directly process the JSON file. <b>Upon clicking upload button, wait for the process to complete.</b>
            It will show the time to complete on uploads.

        <h3># Analysis page</h3>
        <img src="images\analysis_page.PNG" alt="Analysis Page">

            This Analaysis page gives 10 questions and code for that. 
            upon clicking the data that will gives the result in dataframe.
            stremlit data was limited to show only one table. so, make the query to display only one table.
        </p>
        <h4># Plot page</h4>
        <img src="images\plotting_page.PNG" alt="Plotting page">

            There are multiple charts can be added to this page. but made limited no of charts only.
